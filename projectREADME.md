::Approach

I wanted the order process to be simple, ideally creating one instance of an order and having various ways
to process the order. This has led designing public methods from the order class to call on methods from other classes.
Here's an example in irb:

Michaels-MacBook-Pro:takeaway-challenge MichaelLo$ irb
require './lib/menu'
 => true

menu = Menu.new.show
 => {"chips"=>1, "oreo"=>3, "cake"=>2}

order = Order.new('cake')
 => #<Order:0x007f902ba481f8 @menu=#<Menu:0x007f902ba48158 @menu={"chips"=>1, "oreo"=>3, "cake"=>2}>, @order={"cake"=>1}>

order.add('oreo',5)
 => 5

order.view
 => {"cake"=>1, "oreo"=>5}

order.deduct('oreo')
 => 4

order.view
 => {"cake"=>1, "oreo"=>4}

order.place
"*****'---------------'******"
"****'                  '****"
"**'                      '**"
"*'                        '*"
"*        Your Order        *"
"*'========================'*"
"*     Item     Quantity   . *"
"*'========================'*"
".       cake      1        ."
".       oreo      4        ."
"*'========================'*"
"       Order Total: Â£14      "
"*'                        '*"
"**'                      '**"
"******'---------------'*****"
 => "******'---------------'*****"

order.confirm
"Your text confirmation is on it's way!"
"Your confirmation should be along shortly!"
 => "Your confirmation should be along shortly!"
