As a customer
So that I can check if I want to _order_ something
I would like to _see a list of dishes with prices_

As a customer
So that I can _order_ the meal I want
I would like to be able to _select some number of several available dishes_

As a customer
So that I can verify that my _order is correct_
I would like to check that the _total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order_

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to _receive a text_ such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered

* Ensure you have a _list of dishes with prices_
* _Place the order_ by giving the:
 - list of _dishes_,
 - their _quantities_ and
 - a _number that should be the exact total_. (prices * qty)
   - If the _sum is not correct_ the method should _raise an error_
   - , otherwise the customer is _sent a text_ saying that
   -- the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now,
   -- e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".


The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. It’s free.
Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
Use the Gemfile to manage your gems
Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
Note that you can only send texts in the same country as you have your account. I.e. if you have a UK account you can only send to UK numbers.
