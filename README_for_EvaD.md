## Takeaway!

 It's Friday night, you worked hard all week. You're dying to be finally home to chill out and enter weekend mode. You're starving, but the last thing you want to do is cook.


 Say no more: our takeaway is here to save the day. We offer a range of delicious, freshly made meals, that will satisfy all tastes. We specialize in vegan/plant based foods that nourish the body and soul... Now the most difficult part will be to choose what to order!


 ## User Stories

  - As a customer</br>
  So that I can check if I want to order something</br>
  I would like to see a list of dishes with prices</br>

This user story will have us creating a list of dishes with their matching prices. A data structure with keys and matching values probably means the use of a hash in this case. Our program's main object will be a Menu class for now. My logic at this point would be to declare this hash as a constant of our class (as this is our takeway menu customers can choose from).


  - As a customer</br>
  So that I can order the meal I want</br>
  I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes</br>





  - As a customer</br>
  So that I can verify that my order is correct</br>
  I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order




  - As a customer
  So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
  I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered

  I believe that the functionality to receive a text relies on a an API call. I believe this API will be need to be integrated to our gem file to have our object
