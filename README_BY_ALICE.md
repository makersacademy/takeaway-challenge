## Approach / Lessons learned
- initially mapped out functions 
- diagrammed flowchart of functions 
- decided to use Menu as user interface 
- lesson learned - work on one thing / class at a time. Can always extract and refactor later. 

## Classes
### Menu
- User interface i.e. to initialize order, add/remove, confirm and place order.
- Responsible for loading and opening menu
- \#menu(csv)
- \#open
- \#add_item (order.add_item)
- \#remove_item (order.remove_item)
- \#review_order (order_total.current_order)
- \#confirm_order (review_order, text_confirmation)

### Order
- Responsible for adding and removing items from basket
- \#basket
- \#add_item
- \#remove_item

### (Order_Total)
- \#calculate_total
- \#current_order

### (Confirm_Order)
- \#confirm
- \#write_order(csv) 
- \#send_text
