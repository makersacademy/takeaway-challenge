## Takeaway Challenge - Solo - Abdul Mobarak

Following our training session with Roi who showed us how to break down user stories and make a plan before coding; I will break down the user stories and create a flowchart, thinking about my classes, objects, methods, variables etc.

#### User stories

> ~~As a customer. So that I can~~ ***check*** ~~if I want to~~ ***order*** ~~something. I would like to~~ ***see*** ~~a list of~~ ***dishes***  ~~with~~ ***prices***.

> ~~As a customer. So that I can~~ ***order*** ~~the meal I want. I would like to be able to~~ ***select*** ~~some number of several~~ ***available dishes***

> ~~As a customer. So that I can~~ ***verify*** ~~that my order is~~ ***correct***. ~~I would like to~~ ***check*** ~~that the~~ ***total*** ~~I have been given~~ ***matches*** ~~the~~ ***sum*** ~~of the~~ ***various dishes*** ~~in my~~ ***order***.

> ~~As a customer. So that I am reassured that my order will be~~ ***delivered on time***. ~~I would like to~~ ***receive*** ~~a~~ ***text*** ~~such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have~~ ***ordered***.
