Takeaway

I chose takeaway as I trusted I could fulfil the user stories happily and get the opportunity to learn some API.

However, I got stuck on userinput loops in rspec using stubs.

I've learnt from this exercise that I need to work more on loops and stubs, as this is where I eventually got stuck.

I could not provide two stubs in the rspec and recieve both answers in my result, and I believe it was both not understanding stubs correctly, and not having my loop work right 

As, when testing in IRB, it would not end the loop despite me coding in breaks which I fulfilled.

I know I have not used loops much prior to this, aside from the 'do' loop, as well as barely having had to use breaks before, especially when woven into user input (gets.chomp)

And I know I have little understanding of mocks, though this has helped me further that understanding a little more.

Whilst dissapointed that I could not complete the challenge, or at least get onto the API section, I have learnt a lot from this exercise and know that I need to try and apply more loops and mocks in future, to practice them.
