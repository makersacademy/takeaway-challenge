I have followed these steps for twilio:
1. Signed up 
2. Gem install twilio-ruby
3. Added gem 'twilio-ruby' in the gemfile
4. Ran bundle install 
5. Ran brew tap twilio/brew && brew install twilio
6. Logged into twilio in the terminal
7. Ran twilio autocomplete zsh
8. Made a sms.rb file that would send the message
9. Made an .env file in which I added the identification details for twilio
10. I installed the dotenv gem
11. Added gem "dotenv" to my gemfile
12. Ran bundle
13. made a .gitignore file in which I put the .env file as well as the sms.rb file


When I ran sms.rb with the authentication details inside the file, it worked, however when it came to using the .env file, it did not work. Based on the error message, I tried to figure out what was the issue, I found a stackoverflow question, and the answer mentioned not having the right Account SID. I tried various ways of writing the information in the .env file, to no avail.
The text class and test has been made, I just need to continue my research and fix the issue with my sms.rb file. Once I do that, I will write the tests for the send_text method by using a double for sms.rb. I will then write the code to pass the tests.
