Notes:
1. Have created a basic takeaway app and got the send mesages working.
2. I haven't used any doubles on the testing as was keen to get to the messaging part
which was really fun to do.
3. Given more time I would go back and strengthen the main app and check for edge cases/ add in doubles/re-factor.
4. Overall spent about 5 hours getting it to this point.
