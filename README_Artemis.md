Challenge is partially complete. 
There are two classes: one for takeaway and one for orders. They both instantiate new objects and they also print the menu. The add_to_order method is not complete yet, so will give an error message during the feature and unit tests.

Next steps are to create methods to:
add the order in the basket
check the summary of the order
add the costs and have a total amount of the order
add the SMS API

Also, there is still high coupling between classes and low cohesion, which needs to be fixed with the addition of doubles and by refactoring.
