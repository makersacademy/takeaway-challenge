2 objects- takeaway, dishes

3rd object- message

Takeaway

(select dish/ place order) - leads to send message
(display/checks total price matches with dishes)
method: place order?, see_menu, 


dishes
(displays prices of all dishes)
@price, @name


sendmessage
(sends message, twillo)
(use mock for takeaway?  or mock for sendmessage)



**Extra**

Ensure you have a list of dishes with prices

Place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. 

If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".


The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
Use the Gemfile to manage your gems



Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
(not sure what mock to use)
(mock dish? message?)




However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent

Note that you can only send texts in the same country as you have your account. I.e. if you have a UK account you can only send to UK numbers.



Write tests for each user story
