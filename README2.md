So far I have downloaded the twilio-ruby gemfile and have begun to think about the different classes I will need. Unfortunately during the set-up of my Text sender class I encoutered the problem "can not load twilio-ruby file", I'm not sure why this is happening as I followed the sets as suggested. Have asked for help on slack but so far no responses...
