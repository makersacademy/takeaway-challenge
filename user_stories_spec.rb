# The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
# Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
# Use the Gemfile to manage your gems
# Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs,
#as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
# However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
# Note that you can only send texts in the same country as you have your account.
#I.e. if you have a UK account you can only send to UK numbers.
