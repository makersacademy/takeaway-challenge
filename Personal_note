Makers Academy weekend challenge week 2 Takeaway-Challenge

My thoughts and intentions behind this code.

Things I have done:

I tried to write my code after the four rules for simple design. 
I’m not experienced enough to tell if I I fulfilled all the rules. 
I tried to cover all the user stories. 
I struggled with displaying the total amount.

Ideas I had but couldn’t fulfil:

I thought about creating a Checkout class with a checkout method. 
I wanted to create a new instance of Checkout that includes all the data we collected in TakeAway, such as the basket summary etc. That would have stopped the user from changing the order after the checkout.

Conclusion:

I learned a lot this week. 
I felt a lot safer working on my own and I got more confident and relaxed with errors.
My work abilities and the quality of my work improved since last week.
My work is still far from perfect.
I’ not satisfied with my work but I’m not disappointed. 
It gets better every day.
