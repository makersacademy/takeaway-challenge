I would like feedback on the following:

* Are my classes coupled enough?

* Are they loosely coupled?

* Could I have used keyword arguments better to make my code more changeable later?

* How would these classes work together as a program if they are so loosely coupled. Do I need a customer ordering interface to implement the public methods of my classes? Or should one of my classes be doing this already e.g. restaurant?

* Am I accessinging my attributes correctly in my restaurant methods? Should I be using the method rather than the instance variable?
