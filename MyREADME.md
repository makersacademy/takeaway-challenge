Approach
-------

* Struggled to find a coherent approach and to TDD.
* Started with Domain Modeling (see in Docs).
* Started drafting a Menu class, but found it difficult to methodically represent each story.
* Frustration kicked in and I ended up drafting some basic code to partially cover the first two user stories.
* Not happy with results, but couldn't do better on my own this weekend.
