##Challenge: To make a takeaway programme that will text the user a response for ordering a takeaway.

USER STORIES:

- As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices
(tick)

- As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes
(-) Place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total

- As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

- As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered


##Can get it to run seperately. That's about it. Sorry.
#To run add your own number to the 'to' variable in the 'send_sms.rb' file (& the company number to the 'from' variable)


gave up on rspec when it kept replying that it couldnt access the 'twilio-ruby' even though it works fine in IRB :/   ??
