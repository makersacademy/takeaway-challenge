# TAKE AWAY CHALLENGE.

This readme contains my approach to the Takeaway Weekend Challenge.

- i planned to make two classes. Menu and Order.

- The Menu class would contain just a method to check a hash created with the menu and the price, so it is possible for the client to print it.

- The Class Order, would contains methods for place the order, sum the menu items, and check the order is correct.
if everything is correct a message will be send to the client.

- I have struggled terribly with the creation of the test eventhough the code i have been working on appears to work correctly.

- At the state of the code in this moment i ve able to finish the Menu Class and the Order Class to the point of placing orders.

All is tested in working properly and comply with the requirements of the user stories.

I offer a partial solution as long as i have not implemented a method for sending the message.
