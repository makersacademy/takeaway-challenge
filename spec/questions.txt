questions:
how to google for information like "how do set up a hash
in rspec so it's usable in the Class?"

very basic questions in rspec are hard to get answers to
lots of documentation, very little guidance found

eventually found a suggestion mentioning springf
found this on https://idiosyncratic-ruby.com/49-what-the-format.html
don't fully understand it
but decided this was enough to use info from exemplar answers

struggle - how to start, process help
how to better understand details of user journeys
how to break this down
how to use TDD to iterate on tests when understanding is weak

how to read error messages better
how to use map - vaguely came up during pre-course but lack of
feedback or ability to check understanding meant I never used it
