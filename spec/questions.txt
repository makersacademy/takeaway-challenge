questions:
how to google for information like "how do set up a hash
in rspec so it's usable in the Class?"

very basic questions in rspec are hard to get answers to
lots of documentation, very little guidance found

eventually found a suggestion mentioning springf
found this on https://idiosyncratic-ruby.com/49-what-the-format.html
don't fully understand it
but decided this was enough to use info from exemplar answers
