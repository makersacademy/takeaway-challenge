#note to peer reviewer- I've been using Doubles and stubs for the last couple of weeks,
#I was curious when Katerina mentioned that there's a second school of thought that just uses the normal classes
#I thought I'd give that a try for this project, so it's not that I don't know how to use doubles, I chose not to,
#to see what it would be like.

#my original idea was to have the Order class as just a dumb store for variables, which is why it has so much interaction with TakeAway
#unfortunately, the order class evolved as I developed it and is now more complex.  A next step would be to decouple the order,
#and TakeAway classes, as they are now more separate.
