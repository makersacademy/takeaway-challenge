Task

* Write a Takeaway program with the following user stories:

As a customer:.....
```
1. I would like to see a list of dishes with prices
2. I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes
3. I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order
4. I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

What the program can do:

Basically simple functionality:

- it can print a menu
- it can select dishes
- it can total the price of the dishes
- it can send a confirmation message when placing an order
- it can delete the contents of the basket and start again

Blockers:

- I did not know where to start
- I did not break it down and go for simplicity
- Setting the state in RSpec. I need to get better at that. I kept forgetting what was required to build a test
- I felt like I couldn't draw on any of the last two weeks.
- Think of simple tests, basic tests. I think I'm taking RSpec too literally

Challenges

- Everything....ha!
- Shoving things into a Hash. That syntax confuses me
- Twilio was a pain to sort out. I think I lucked out on finding the correct resource to help me.
- The quantity confused me slightly, I had to ask for help on that

Learning Outcomes:

- That I need to return to RSpec basics and understand how to write good, basic tests, and then build from there
- I need to plan better, map out, draw diagrams etc and just think with common sense about what a takeaway service might look like
- I cannot afford to panic and stare blankly at a screen for hours when my brain is saying I'm shit
- As above I need a panic list
- Ironically I gave myself ALL of the weekend for this and my best hours were the last couple of hours on Sunday night
waiting for the f***** cat to stop fighting with another car and come inside so I can go to bed!!!!!
