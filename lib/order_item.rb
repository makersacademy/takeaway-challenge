class OrderItem
# OrderItem instances are the items the user has selected:
# they are instantiated with a number, name, price, *and QUANTITY*
# and is initialized with named parameters of :number, :name, :price, :quantity (also on attr_reader)
# the OrderItem objects are distinct from MenuItem objects, as they have
# an assigned quantity. Also, in terms of scaling, a user could add notes (e.g.
# 'add extra cheese and pepperoni' or 'no shrimp please') when placing the order.
