The nouns were split into owners & properties.
The actions were split into who owned them.
The actions were then given the properties that they read/write.
This resulted in:

class       --> dishes
properties  --> cost of dishes
            --> name of dishes
actions     --> read

class       --> total
properties  --> list of dishes
            --> current order
actions     --> add to order
            --> read order
            --> sum order

class       --> text
properties  --> total
            --> time
            --> order completed
actions     --> send


I then moved on to writing a failing test for the initialize method of my first class 'Dishes'. These tests checked to make sure that an array of hashes was created, and that this array included both names and costs for the dishes. The list also needed to be printable.
I then wrote tests to make the test pass, then refactored my test.

I then wrote a test to list all of the given dishes and their costs. When implementing this code, i recognised that i just needed a hash, not an array of hashes. This meant that i had to re-write my code/checks to reflect this.
Created a new document for the dishes, and moved current code and tests to the appropriate documents.

I then wrote tests for a new takeaway class, which would handle the menu, the order and the text message at the end. Once the tests were failing, I made the new class with a number of different variable that i knew i would need.

The first functionality of the takeaway class that i tested/worked on was the 'show  a list of dishes with prices', which would print the menu from the dishes class.

Then i ordered on being able to make a order. Once i had the test/code passing for this, i decided to make a new order class to handle the dishes required and the overall cost.

Added a conditional to return whether the customer has placed an order yet.

Began to work on returning the cost of the dish/order.

i have made a new array to just store the costs of the dishes. This is now called when adding a dish to the order, and is adding the cost to the total cost of the order.

I have also written a test and the code to finish an order.

I found out through feature testing that the orders werent being stored correctly, so i editted the code to push them properly. However i am not happy with the method i used and would like to find a better solution.

I have not included the text functionality as i havnet had time to research the methods required.
