## Domain Modelling

The Takeaway app is split up into various classes that understand the behaviour of various methods. The classes encapsulate these behaviours. 

The Takeaway app is based on my favorite takeaway option - Hawaiian PokÃ© Bowls!

The takeaway class understands the behaviour of the view_menu, add_item and view_order methods.

- Class ----> takeaway
- Method (behaviour) ----> view_menu, add_item and view_order 

The order class understands the behavious of the add_to_order, order_summary and basket_total methods.

- Class ----> order
- Method (behaviour) ----> add_to_order, order_summary and basket_total

The menu class understands the behaviour of the menu method.

- Class ----> menu
- Method (behaviour) ----> menu
