Takeaway Challenge
------------------
Maker Academy Week 2 weekend challenge

This project is to create a takeaway program that:
* has a menu with prices
* allows the customer to choose dishes
* allows the customer to check the price total
* sends a text message to the customer to confirm delivery

The text message function is implemented using the Twilio API.

User stories provided:

```

I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
