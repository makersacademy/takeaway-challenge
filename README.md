### Motivation

This is a weekend project conducted as part of the Makers Academy course. The aim of the project is to develop and test skills independently. Particular areas of focus will be:

- TDD, test driving from start to finish. Practice feature testing with rspec.
- Creating classes and identifying if one is exceeding a single responsibility. Extracting classes if that becomes the case and doing so whilst maintaining test coverage.
- Unit testing classes in isolation using mocking.
- Practice using a Gemfile to manage gems.
- Use an API (Twilio)

### Build status

Operational but incomplete - Satisfied up until User story 3.
I had planned to do the following in order to finish the challenge:

- Incorporate an error message if the order total is incorrect
- If total is correct, send a text to the customer by implementing Twilio API
- Look into environment variables
- Update the Gemfile
- Further update the README

### Tech/framework used

__Built with__

* Ruby
* Rspec

### Features

The user is able to:

* View a formatted menu list
* Add dishes and quantities to their order
* Verify the total cost of their order

### Installation

To make use of this project clone it from GitHub by doing the following:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone <repo url>` in your terminal.
2. Then type `bundle install` to install gems (Rspec)

### API Reference

### Tests

### How to use

### Credits

After hitting a mental wall, I referred to Jordan Roberts' solution: https://github.com/jordantroberts/takeaway-challenge. I found her spec files clear and understandable. In doing so I was able to reassess my approach and continue on with the task.
