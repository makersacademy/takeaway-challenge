#Takeaway Challenge [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hibreez/takeaway-challenge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hibreez/takeaway-challenge)[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/hibreez/takeaway-challenge/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/hibreez/takeaway-challenge?branch=master)

A Takeaway restaurant ordering system for the [takeaway challenge]
(https://github.com/makersacademy/takeaway-challenge), 
using [twilio-ruby](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-ruby) to send a text to confirm orders.  

A `Takeaway`
* displays it's `Menu` as a formatted list of dishes and prices,  
* accepts user's `Order`s in plain text and confirms their price,   
* uses it's `Phone` to send SMS messages with a delivery time.   


####Installation  
```
git clone git@github.com:hibreez/takeaway-challenge.git  
cd takeaway-challenge  
gem install bundler  
bundle
```
To receive the SMS messages you will have to make a (free) 
[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) account and then set up three environment 
variables:
`ACCOUNTSID=` Your Twilio Account SID.  
`AUTHTOKEN=` Your Twilio Auth Token.  
`MYPHONE=` A verified phone number to receive the messages.  
You can set these globally or just in the file `.env` in the project root.
