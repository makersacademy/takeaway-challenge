# Takeaway Challenge

## Installation

Simply clone this repo using your terminal of choice, then use your prefered IDE or text editor to edit/ run individual files.

### Dependancies

* ruby v 2.5.0
* rspec (for running the tests)
* bundler (for Gem installation)

## Test instructions

To run the included tests simply enter *rspec* into cmd/ terminal inside the *takeaway-challenge* directory. if successful you should see an output like so:

  ```
     Finished in 0.00111 seconds (files took 0.33824 seconds to load)
     10 examples, 0 failures  
  ```

if you get an error saying that *rspec* is not a recognised command then you need to install rspec. do this, then run the command again
