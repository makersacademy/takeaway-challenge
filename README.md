I have completed this challenge via the walk through tutorial found on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgiJKdH9x8c)

I started the project by using the Struct class to build an easier way to refer to prices and dishes. However, I could not refer to the Struct class easily. A better solution was to use hashes all along as it turns out to be easier to create stubs in the tests.

Also I was under the impression that I had to "puts" messages to the user, and it turned out to be a great challenge to run RSpec testing when you have a sequence of puts and gets in the same method.
