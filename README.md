 So that I can check if I want to order something
 I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

 So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
 I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered

 =================

 ## Methodology

 1. First break down the user stories and identify nouns and verbs to determine the classes and methods that would be required.

 2. Created a files for each class: `Takeaway` and `Menu`.

 3. Created spec files for each class: 'takeaway_spec.rb' and 'menu_spec.rb'.

 4. Started writing tests to check functionality.

 5. Used 'rubocop' to ensure best practice formatting.

 6. Add methods to the corresponding classes to pass the tests.

 ## How to use

 Bellow is a pry transcript of how the program runs from a users perspective:

```
[1] pry(main)> require './lib/order'
=> true
[2] pry(main)> dominos = Takeaway.new
=> #<Takeaway:0x007ffb1a87f858
 @order=
  #<Order:0x007ffb1a87f808
   @customer_order={},
   @menu=
    {:Milano=>19.99,
     :Ardente=>19.99,
     :Sicilia=>19.99,
     :Verona=>19.99,
     :Roma=>19.99}>>
[3] pry(main)> dominos.order.add_item(:Roma, 5)
=> 5
[4] pry(main)> dominos.order.add_item(:Margherita, 2)
RuntimeError: Item is not on the menu.
from /Users/anthonycrisp/Desktop/Projects/TakeAway/takeaway-challenge/lib/order.rb:15:in `add_item'
[5] pry(main)> dominos.order.add_item(:Milano, 1)
=> 1
[6] pry(main)> dominos.order.summary
Roma x 5
Milano x 1
Your total: Â£119.94
=> nil
[7] pry(main)> dominos.order.send_sms(+44**********)
=> "sent"
[8] pry(main)>
```
