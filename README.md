Takeaway Challenge
==================

Intro
-------
* The challenge is writing a takeaway programme that sends a text message when the order is placed and total confirmed. The features are implemented according to the following user stories.

Approach
-----
* Class structure :

- Restaurant class (takeaway interface)
- Order class (places & calculate order total)
- Menu class (contains dishes)
- Messenger module (twilio)

The classes are structured in the following hierarchy :

* Restaurant ---> Order ---> Menu, with Twilio as a module that sends text messages when order is complete. 

Currently rspec tests need to have better coverage and I am hoping to complete the rspec test for the messenger module.

Gems List
------
gem 'rspec'
gem 'rubocop'
gem 'coveralls', require: false
gem 'rubocop-rspec'
gem 'capybara'
gem 'twilio-ruby'
gem 'dotenv', '~> 2.0', '>= 2.0.2'


```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

* Hints on functionality to implement:
  * ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
  * place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
  * The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
  * Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
  * Use a Gemfile to manage your gems
  * Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
  * However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent

* Advanced! (have a go if you're feeling adventurous):
  * Implement the ability to place orders via text message.

* A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.
* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am


**Note: We are looking for good OO design and programming! Remember the Single Responsibility and Dependency Injection/Inversion principles!**
