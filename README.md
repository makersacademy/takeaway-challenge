Takeaway Challenge
==================

About the challenge
-------
* This is Week 2 Challenge at Makers Academy.
* The program is for a takeaway restaurant that allows customers to order dishes from a menu, check prices and total cost.
Completed orders will receive a SMS confirming when their order will be delivered.

Task
-----

* Fill out your learning plan self review for the week: https://github.com/makersacademy/learning_plan (if you haven't already)
* Spend an hour composing a blog post to answer the question `What is a ruby gem? Give a code example showing how to use a ruby gem in a piece of code. What are some dangers to using a gem?`
* Fork this repo
* run the command 'bundle' in the project directory to ensure you have all the gems
* Write a Takeaway program with the following user stories:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

* Hints on functionality to implement:
  * ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
  * place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
  * The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
  * Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
  * Use a Gemfile to manage your gems
  * Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
  * However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent

* Advanced! (have a go if you're feeling adventurous):
  * Implement the ability to place orders via text message.

* A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.
* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am

**Note: We are looking for good OO design and programming! Remember the Single Responsibility and Dependency Injection/Inversion principles!**

How to run the program
----------------------
Use IRB from Terminal to run this program.

```
$ require './lib/customer.rb'
$ customer_name = Customer.new
To create a new customer

$ customer_name.menu.pricelist
To see the menu and price

$ customer_name.make_order("dish", quantity)
To make an order

```
