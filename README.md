Introduction
-------
The Take Away application is part of a weekend challenge at the Makers Academy in London. I built my application with and OOP approach and the intent was to extract as many objects that I could identify in to its own ruby classes.

The application allows a user to build a take away restaurant and add dishes to its menu and control the incoming orders.

A customer will be given a list of available dishes and the restaurant is able to take orders and add dishes to its order. The customer will be able get an order status and make sure everything is correct according to the order. The customer will be given an overview of the order and the total of the order. Further the customer will be sent a text message confirming the order and time of delivery which will be 1 hour after the order has been placed.

The application has an integrated text message confirmation system that uses the Twilio API.


Installation
-----
* Run the command 'bundle install' in the project directory to ensure you have all the gems.


How to use the applicaton
-----

To run the program require the dependencies.rb file.

* Create your take away restaurant
  my_restaurant = Restaurant.new
* Start adding dishes with name, price and available amount to your menu
  my_restaurant.add_dish("Name of your dish", 12, 5)
* Show the customer the menu with available dishes
  my_restaurant.show_menu
* Add to an order by choosing dish number from the menu and amount
  restaurant.add_to_order(1, 3)
* Let the customer get an order status
  restaurant.order_status
* Checkout the order and send a text message confirmation to the customer
  restaurant.finish_order("Customer's phone number")

Areas to improve
-----

* Keep track of available dishes
* Edge cases
* Payment system
* Test environment
