Takeaway Challenge		[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UsmanJ/takeaway-challenge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/UsmanJ/takeaway-challenge)	[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/UsmanJ/takeaway-challenge/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/UsmanJ/takeaway-challenge?branch=master)
======================

Instructions
-----

Create a system for a takeaway which can be used as a till. This means it should be able to do the following:
- Display a menu with prices
- Add items to an order
- Place an order and display receipt
- Send a confirmation text to customer
- Update prices


Approach towards solving the challenge
--------------------------------------

To begin with, it was important to decide on how many classes the system needed. I decided to use two classes. One for the menu and the other for the orders. I also added an additional module for the text method to keep this separate.

I built the system using test-driven development to ensure that bugs can be eliminated. As you can see the build has 100% coveralls.

The takeaway system if fully functional. If you feel that there are any errors or improvements can be made then please let me know.


Steps of using the takeaway system
---------------------------------
```
irb(main):001:0> require './lib/customer.rb'
=> true
irb(main):002:0> customer = Customer.new
=> #<Customer:0x007fe719975ee8 @menu=#<Menu:0x007fe719975ec0 @menu_list={"4x chicken wings"=>1.59, "chicken burger meal"=>4.49, "fries"=>1.29, "pizza"=>4.99}>, @order={}, @order_total=0, @total_items=0>
irb(main):003:0> customer.display_menu
4x chicken wings - £1.59
chicken burger meal - £4.49
fries - £1.29
pizza - £4.99
=> {"4x chicken wings"=>1.59, "chicken burger meal"=>4.49, "fries"=>1.29, "pizza"=>4.99}
irb(main):004:0> customer.select_dish('chicken burger meal', 2)
=> 8.98
irb(main):005:0> customer.select_dish('pizza', 1)
=> 13.97
irb(main):006:0> customer.order_total_cost
=> "Total    £13.97"
irb(main):007:0> customer.receipt
=> "2x chicken burger meal - £8.98, 1x pizza - £4.99"
```
