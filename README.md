            //  \_____:_____.-------D     )))))
           //   | ===  |   /        \
       .:'//.   \ \=|   \ /  .:'':./    )))))
      :' // ':   \ \ ''..'--:'-.. ':

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```
