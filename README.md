Task
-----

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

For this challenge I successfully implemented the functionality required from the user stories above, however I struggled when it came to testing for the Twilio API functionality. I have commented out the code for this reason, however, when it is uncommented it successfully sends a text. 
One other area I felt less confident with is seperating out classes.
