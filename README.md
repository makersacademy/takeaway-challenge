Takeaway_challenge is the the Maker's Academy week 2 Friday Challenge. The aim is to write a Takeaway programme that will satisfy the following user stories:

As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered.

I have created several different classes to try to stick to the single responsibility principle. I have managed to get twilio to send messages from the app.rb. The final step is now to incorporate this into my code.
