## Task

Week 2 Makers Academy challenge:  
Description of user stories expected to be implemented:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered

## Details about app and process:

To develop this application I have followed a strict TDD approach and the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR process.

App has 4 classes and 4 testing spec file corresponding to each class.

Once the main functionality of the app ahs been tested and setup I have refactored the code and extracted several classes: list.rb, dish.rb, messaging.rb. These classes have been tested in isolation by using doubles and stubbing methods where needed in order to force and test behaviour.

I have stuck more than ever tot he principle of testing behaviour rather then state.

Following the SRP principle, I have delegate responsability and attempted to maintain classes cohesive. Though this is a work in progress as further classes can be extracted to make the available classes more flexibile:

- display menu and selected dishes
- calculator to caclulate total based on different VAT regimes

The messaging class has not been throughly tested.

I have not implemented the extra requirement of sending an order via an sms.
