* Hints on functionality to implement:

  * Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run

* Advanced! (have a go if you're feeling adventurous):
  * Implement the ability to place orders via text message.
