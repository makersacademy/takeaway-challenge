Background
-------

The second weekend challenge at makers academy, we were challenged to emulate a takeaway delivery service. The task is detailed below.
Throughout this project I further developed skills in TDD/BDD, refactoring, using mocks, doubles and stubs. I also became more confident in using hashes to store data and manipulating them for expected results.

Task
-----

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```
