Task
-------
As part of a weekend challenge at Makers Academy, I was given the task to convert some user stories into a fully functioning takeaway service program. The user will see a menu before selecting some items from it then they will see a sum of their order so they know how much they need to pay. See the user stories below.

As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

Approach
-------
For each user story I:
* created a domain model, identified objects and messages
* ran irb simulation to get an idea what I will need my code to do
* wrote a unit test using rspec which reflects the outcome
* allowed my unit test to drive my code
* made sure my test coverage was 100% by checking statistics generated by SimpleCov
* ran rubocop to check for offences
* used irb to check that the acceptance tests now pass
* enapsulated objects and methods based on their behaviour (i.e. twilio class). 

Before starting, I mapped out a model for the whole process as a guide. 

I added a Twilio Gem and managed this in my Gemfile by running the bundle command (available when using Bundler). 
Created an account on Twilio.com and used my free phone number to set up twilio within my ruby file twilio.rb so that I can send a text message to my phone. Created environment variables to hide my twilio account details and mobile numbers.


User Software Guide
-------
You can run this application manually in irb by calling 'ruby takeaway.rb'. By following the instructions give you can add menu items by selecting the number of the item you want listed in order. If you want to finish adding items to your order you can press enter. This will then show you a sum of your order total. 

You can add more items to the takeaway menu manually in the takeaway.rb file. 

You can only send text messages to UK phone numbers. 


irb usage example
-------


Edge Cases
-------
- ensured shopping_cart starts empty


Unresolved
-------

- ability to show item with quanity instead of listing the item multiple times in the order summary
- raise an error if the sum of the order is not correct otherwise send customer text message such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52"
- use a stub to mock sending a text functionality using twilio
- make sure text is sent when order is ran through irb
