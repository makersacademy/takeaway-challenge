### Takeaway Challenge

I took a methodical approach to this challenge using TDD.

The steps I would take for each user story:

1. RED - Write a feature test in  ```spec/features/user_stories_spec.rb``` based on the user story given. See it fail, and then write a unit test for the relevant class to fail with the same error message.

2. GREEN - Make the feature test and unit test pass.

3. Refactor. Write further unit tests as necessary to comply with the user stories requirements and repeat RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for these tests

4. Repeat 1 to 3 for each user story.
