The takeaway challenge is a 'Friday Challenge' set to try and test your knowledge of OOD, unit testing, feature testing, classes, methods, encapsulation, delegation and testing in isolation.

## Description
The program should allow a customer to see a list of dishes with prices, select some number of several available dishes, check that the total price displayed matches the sum of the dishes in the order and send a text (e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52") after the order is placed.
# NOTE:
"Place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error" - I have interpreted this as in passing in the money the customer wants to pay with. If they pass in more than the total, the extra will be seen as a tip, if less is passed in, then an error is raised.

## Installation
You will need to install bundle.

## Roadmap
--------> If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
