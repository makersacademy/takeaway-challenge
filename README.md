What is Takeaway Challenge?
------
Write a Takeaway program with the following user stories:
```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

 => "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered at 23:23 for Â£18. \n \n Thanks for your order!"
2.2.3 :009 >
```

Technologies Used
-------
* Ruby 2.3.0 
* Rspec 3.3.2
* twilio-ruby gem
* dotenv-rails gem 

Approach and Refactoring
------
* Made three classes: Menu, Order, Message
* I'll add a fourth class called Takeaway to create a single point of entry for the application, as right now the user has to include both Menu and Order seperately.
