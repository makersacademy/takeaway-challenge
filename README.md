# Takeaway Challenge
## Makers Academy Week 2 Weekend Challenge

### What it Does
Emulates an online takeaway food ordering system.

### How to Use
I am not sure yet but watch this space!

### My Approach
I've drawn a very loose diagram to help me visualise the different classes that I might make (so that I don't have to do class extraction at a later point!). The arrows sort of show the relationships between classes. For example, a restaurant has one menu which can have many dishes. The chosen dishes would then be moved to an order. Hopefully this diagram will get a bit more interesting at some point.
