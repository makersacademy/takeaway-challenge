 This program is a model of a takeaway app based on the following user stories:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```


The program is fully functional and has comprehensive test coverage.From here I would like to have fully tested the SMS function. Ideally, I would have constructed the tests before implementing this functionality. It would also have been nice to reduce the number of public methods in the program, particularly in the 'takeaway' class.
