Takeaway Challenge
==================

The task
---------

This task is based on the Makers Academy Weekend 2 challenge [(click here for original README.md)](ORIGINAL_README.md). 

The overall objective is to create a takeaway programme in Ruby, which lets a user select the dishes they want from a menu. It then sends them an SMS message to confirm their order has been placed, using the Twilio API.

The user stories are as follows:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices
```
```
As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes
```
```
As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order
```
```
As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

How to use the program
-----

### Installing ###

1. Clone this repo to your local computer
2. Run the command gem install bundle (if you don't have bundle already)
3. Run the command 'bundle' in the project directory to ensure you have all the necessary gems

### Running ###

This programme uses Ruby. Below is an example of how to run the programme to make an order.

```
$ irb -r "./lib/order.rb"
2.6.5 :001 > menu = Menu.new({ pizza: 4, burger: 3, hot_dog: 2 })
2.6.5 :002 > order = Order.new(menu, account_sid, auth_token, from_number, to_number) # input the relevant details for arguments 2 to 5.
2.6.5 :003 > order.add("pizza", 2)
2.6.5 :004 > order.add("burger", 3)
2.6.5 :005 > order.remove("burger", 1)
2.6.5 :006 > order.summary
2.6.5 :007 > order.pay(14)
```
Upon paying the correct amount (as per the last line), you will receive a confirmation text stating when you can expect your delivery.
Thank you for ordering with Jasiveroo!

Structure
-----
As part of the planning process, I identified the classes that I would need, along with the attributes and methods of each.


I then built each in turn, starting with those which did not depend on any other classes, making my way up to those which had multiple dependencies.


| Object: | Menu |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Attributes:** | dishes |
| **Methods:** | print, search |


| Object: | Basket |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Attributes:** | dishes, menu |
| **Methods:** | add, remove, total, summary |


| Object: | SMS |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Attributes:** | client, account and authorization credentials, sending phone number, receiving phone number |
| **Methods:** | send |


| Object: | Order |
| ------- | ------- |
| **Attributes:** | basket, menu, sms |
| **Methods:** | add, remove, total, summary, pay |

## Further objectives ##

The following is a list of objectives I achieved, in addition to the user requirements:

  * Follow the TDD process, and have all tests passing
  * High test coverage (>99%)
  * Elegant code: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc. Running Rubocop detects no offenses
  * Make sure that the programme is thoroughly tested and mocks and/or stubs are used so as not to send texts when the tests are run
  * However, loading the programme and placing the order in IRB ensures the confirmation text is actually sent

## Features to be added ##

In the future, I would like to implement the following features:
- More extensive use of doubles to further isolate separate class testing
- Use of environment variables to facilitate keeping private information secret
- More extensive testing of the code that relies on the Twilio gem
- The ability to place orders via text message
- Additional printed messages depending on the methods executed
- Description and ingredients of each dish, with the option for the 
user to amend the latter for preference/dietary requirements
- Addition of VAT, delivery fee and promotion discounts, where applicable
