Takeaway Challenge
==================

User Story 1
-----

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices
```

Inital thoughts is this would be best as a hash with dish number, name and price as keys, within a method that can be run to show the full list (aka menu). Needs to be accessible from the start, so user can check if they want to order something.
