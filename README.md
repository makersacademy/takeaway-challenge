Takeaway Challenge
==================

Week 2 Weekend Challenge
-------

For the second weekend challenge, I had to create a program that allowed orders to be given to a takeaway, from a specific menu, and then would send out a confirmation text when the order was completed. First, I created a Menu class and then wrote code allowing the menu to be viewed and food to be ordered from the menu. Finally, I made it so that when the order was confirmed, a text would be sent out using the Twilio API.

In irb, the code worked like this:

    2.2.3 :009 > pizza = Menu.new
      => #<Menu:0x007fe49291ae00 @dishes={"margherita"=>4.5, "al funghi"=>5.5, "hot & spicy"=>6.0, "calzone"=>7.5, "hawaiian"=>6.5, "chicken supreme"=>9.5, "garlic bread"=>3.0}>
    2.2.3 :010 > takeaway = Takeaway.new(pizza)
      => #<Takeaway:0x007fe4930384d0 @menu=#<Menu:0x007fe49291ae00 @dishes={"margherita"=>4.5, "al funghi"=>5.5, "hot & spicy"=>6.0, "calzone"=>7.5, "hawaiian"=>6.5, "chicken supreme"=>9.5, "garlic bread"=>3.0}>, @basket={}, @cost=#<OrderCost:0x007fe4930382c8 @total=0>>
    2.2.3 :011 > takeaway.order("calzone")
      => "You have just ordered 1x calzone!"
    2.2.3 :012 > takeaway.order("garlic bread", 2)
      => "You have just ordered 2x garlic bread!"
    2.2.3 :013 > takeaway.basket
      => {"calzone x1"=>7.5, "garlic bread x2"=>6.0}
    2.2.3 :014 > takeaway.total
      => "Total: Â£13.50"
    2.2.3 :015 > takeaway.complete_order
      => "Thank you for ordering!"

(And then I received a text!)


If I'd had more time over the weekend, which unfortunately, I didn't, I'd have implemented a way to modify the order so that you could add or remove food that you'd already ordered once. I would also have changed the menu class so that new items could be added and it wouldn't have to be the pizza menu that I specified in my current code.
