My approach to the Takeaway challenge (user stories, instructions and resources
bellow):
1. Domain model based on user stories: I need a Menu class that can print a menu,
can place an order, checks of the total sum is correct, sends and sms to confirm the order

2. I created a constant LIST_OF_DISHES, a hash of dishes and prices

3. I added simple print method, that prints the menu and price - in rspec, it is  
expected to print a constant.

4. I added a select method with 2 arguments - a dish from the menu and
how many times the dish needs to be added. Dishes go into an array of dishes, quantities go into an array of numbers. The method puts the two arrays into a hash called order, which is an instance variable of the Menu class. In Rspec, I tested if a hardcoded order (a hash) has its keys (dishes) included in the LIST_OF_DISHES.

5. The select method fails if the added dish is not in the menu.

6. I added a checkout method taking a 'total' argument, which fails if the total sum is incorrect and send sms if correct.

7. For user story 3, I added a correct_total method, adding all dishes in the
order multiplied by the number of items.

8. For the text message to confirm an order: I created a Twilio account, which gave me a number from which to send text messages and the code allowing me to send a text using my account credentials and my Twilio number.

9. Initially I tried to have a send text method within my Menu class, but it had too many dependencies and I was getting too many errors. Also, menus don't really send you text messages, so here's to SRP. I made a new class Textsms, which only has one method, namely the send(text) method.

10. I modified the send method in the Textsms class so it takes an argument (the Twilio code had no arg and the body was hardcoded in the method). Then I added an
@sms (initalized with a new Textsms instance) instance variable to the Menu class and within the checkout method I called sms.send(text).

Here's how to use it in irb:
```
2.4.0 :001 > require './lib/menu'
 => true
2.4.0 :002 > menu=Menu.new
 => #<Menu:0x007fb44c39b0b8 @order={}, @total=0, @dishes=[], @quants=[], @sms=#<Textsms:0x007fb44c39b018>>
2.4.0 :003 > menu.print
 => {"formule1"=>10, "formule2"=>15, "formule3"=>20, "drink"=>5}
2.4.0 :004 > menu.select('formule1',1)
formule1 was added 1 time(s)! Select again if you want to add more
 => [["formule1", 1]]
2.4.0 :005 > menu.select('drink',1)
drink was added 1 time(s)! Select again if you want to add more
 => [["formule1", 1], ["drink", 1]]
2.4.0 :006 > menu.select('drinkssssssss',1)
RuntimeError: Dish not in the menu, try again!
	[...]
2.4.0 :007 > menu.place_order(16)
RuntimeError: The sum is incorrect!
	[...]
2.4.0 :008 > menu.place_order(15)
 => nil
2.4.0 :009 > menu.confirm_order
 => <Twilio::REST::Message @path=/2010-04-01/Accounts/ACfa9b631a7443203be5289bdefa1522b2/Messages/SM8e69afb955994cc6a2f463145c66e690>
2.4.0 :010 >

Instructions
-------

* Challenge time: rest of the day and weekend, until Monday 9am
* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Task
-----

* Fork this repo
* Run the command 'bundle' in the project directory to ensure you have all the gems
* Write a Takeaway program with the following user stories:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

* Hints on functionality to implement:
  * Ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
  * Place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
  * The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
  * Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
  * Use the Gemfile to manage your gems
  * Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
  * However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
  * Note that you can only send texts in the same country as you have your account. I.e. if you have a UK account you can only send to UK numbers.

* Advanced! (have a go if you're feeling adventurous):
  * Implement the ability to place orders via text message.

* A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.
* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am


In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance will make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this weekend.

Notes on Test Coverage
------------------

You can see your [test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) when you run your tests.
