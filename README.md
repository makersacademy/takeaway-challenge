 Welcome to the takeaway program! It models a restaurant where you can order as many of the available dishes as you like. You will also get a text with confirmation of delivery time.

 How to reuse:
 -> set up the restaurant with your Twilio credentials using the Credentials module
 -> change the default number in Text.rb initialize method to your Twilio verified number
 -> add some dishes to the menu class (the takeaway comes with Pad Thai, Ramen and Chicken Teriyaki built in)
 -> for an example of the menu-viewing and food ordering process see the feature_test.rb file

 HAPPY MUNCHING!
