Ruby program that replicates basic functionality of a Takeaway restaurant. Responsibility is split between several classes:
 - Client - requires menu from a specific restaurant, places order and confirms order
 - Menu - keeps a list of items available for Restaurant
 - Restaurant - gives client the menu and registers the final order(food items, total and client phone number) as well as send sms confirmation
 - Order - deals with input from client, checks only items from the menu are ordered and calculates total
 - Service_sms - API used by Restaurant class to send sms, currently sensitive info is hidden using 'dotenv gem'
