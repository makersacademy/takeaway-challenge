## Takeaway Challenge

### Makers Academy - Week 2 Project

#### Objectives for the week
* ✅ Use all of week 1's skills
* ✅ Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
* ✅ Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
* ✅ Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns
* ✅ Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

#### Goals targeted by this challenge
* ✅ I have a methodical approach to solving problems
* ✅ I can TDD anything

#### Challenges
##### User Stories
* [x] As a customer, so that I can check if I want to order something, I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

* [x] As a customer, so that I can order the meal I want, I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

* [x] As a customer, so that I can verify that my order is correct, I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

* [ ] As a customer, so that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time, I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
##### Functionality
* [x] Ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
* [x] Place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. 
* [x] If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error. 
* [ ] Using the twilio app, the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
* [x] App is thoroughly tested and mocks and/or stubs are used as necessary.
  * [x] All tests passing
  * [x] High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
  * [x] The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.
