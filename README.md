The program allows to order food from your favorite take-away. It displays a list of dishes with prices, where you can chose several number of dishes from. Once the order has been placed it displayes the list of choosen dishes with the total for the user to confirm it with Yes or No.
If the total is confirmed then the custormer receives a message with the delivery time, that is usually one hour later.
