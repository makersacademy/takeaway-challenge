* Place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error

#### Order Sum

=> "5.80" # I really wanted to have it with 2 decimals, just like in the menu...
[6] pry(main)> order.double_check("5.80")

```
### Takeaway and sending SMS

The customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
* The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
