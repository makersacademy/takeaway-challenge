* Fork this repo
* Run the command 'bundle' in the project directory to ensure you have all the gems
* Write a Takeaway program with the following user stories:

## User stories

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

## Completed Tasks
I didn't complete this challenge, if I had more time I would have implemented a lot of my own logic and completed the last user story.

## Completed Tasks
- User Story #1: I would like to see a list of dishes with prices
- User Story #2: I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes
- User Story #3: I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

## Remaining Tasks
- Working feature tests
- User story #4: I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered

# Code Review

* All tests should be passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code should be elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.
* Reviewed against this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance will make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this weekend.
