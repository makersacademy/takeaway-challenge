## Bananas Take Away


Welcome to the one and only restaurant in Bananas City!

--- Under Construction ---

At the moment we there isn't much we can do other than showing you what's available from our kitchen.

**In the future, you will be able to:**

- to place an order by giving the name of the dish and quantity

- know how much you'll be charged for your order

- receive a confirmation text, so that you know that we have received your order and that your food will be delivered on time.


#### Technical details:

I didn't have time this weekend to finish both challenges. This is how I'm thinking to approach this problem:

- the Customer will be responsible making orders by

- the Menu might be turned into a module

- the Restaurant will be responsible for receiving the orders and sending a confirmation to the Customer
