Takeaway Challenge
==================

This program allows the user to view the original McDonalds menu, select any
number of available items from the menu, check a summary of the order before
confirming and receiving a text message upon completion of the order.

Instructions
==================
Clone the repository:

```
https://github.com/FergusLemon/takeaway-challenge.git
```
change into the directory:

```
cd takeaway_challenge
```

and run the tests:

```
rspec
```

To see how the program works, open irb or pry and require the following files:

```
require './lib/menu'
require './lib/order'
require './lib/order_summary'
require './lib/sms'
```

A user can then check the menu, order items and view a summary of their basket
as follows:

```
[5] pry(main)> order = Order.new
=> #<Order:0x007fb8bb156190
 @menu=
  #<Menu:0x007fb8bb156168
   @dishes=
    {"Pure Beef Hamburger"=>1,
     "Tempting Cheeseburger"=>1.5,
     "Triple-Thick Shakes"=>2,
     "Golden French Fries"=>0.5,
     "Thirst-Quenching Coke"=>0.5,
     "Delightful Root Beer"=>0.5,
     "Steamy Hot Coffee"=>0.5,
     "Full-Flavour Orange Drink"=>0.5,
     "Refreshingly Cold Milk"=>0.75}>,
 @summary=#<OrderSummary:0x007fb8bb156118 @basket={}>>
[6] pry(main)> order.add_item("Pure Beef Hamburger")
=> "1 Pure Beef Hamburger(s) added to your order"
[7] pry(main)> order.add_item("Triple-Thick Shakes", 4)
=> "4 Triple-Thick Shakes(s) added to your order"
[8] pry(main)> order.summary
=> #<OrderSummary:0x007fb8bb156118 @basket={"Pure Beef Hamburger"=>1,
"Triple-Thick Shakes"=>4}>
[9] pry(main)> order.total_price
=> 9
```

If a user tries to select a menu that is not on the menu they will receive
an error message:

```
[10] pry(main)> order.add_item("Chicken & chips")
RuntimeError: Sorry we don't have Chicken & chips on the menu
```

To finalise an order a user must confirm the order and the total price as
follows:

```

[11] pry(main)> order.confirm_order(9)
```
The user will receive a text message saying that they will receive their order
within the hour.  If the user inputs a total price that is different to the
total calculated by the program they receive an error message:

```

[12] pry(main)> order.confirm_order(8)
RuntimeError: Sorry our records don't match, we believe the total price is Â£9.  
Please check your order.
```
