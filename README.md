## User Stories

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices
```

`noun` = list, dishes
`verb` = see

```
As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes
```

`noun` = dishes
`verb` = select

```
As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order
```

`noun` = name, game
`verb` = check,

```
As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
