Takeaway Challenge  
==================

Project Brief   
----
* Write a Takeaway program with the below user stories
* Ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
* Place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total.
* If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error
* If the sum is correct, the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
* If the Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, a text confirming the order should actually be sent
* Extension task:
 * Implement the ability to place orders via text message.
