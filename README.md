## Makers - Week 2 - Weekend challenge

This challenge is to create a takeaway app that integrates with Twilio to send SMS order confirmations.

This will be written in Ruby and implemented using test driven development using the Rspec framework.

## Progress report

  - SMS sample test working with environment variables but not currenlty functioning in app in IRB - blocked atm
  - Disclaimer - I had some help writing my Rspec test for sms
  - Still to do - create order class and split takeaway/order
  - Still to do - use Timecop to add time +1hr to sms message
  - Still to do - deal with edge cases eg negative quantities in orders
