About this project
-------
This program enables a user to place orders from a set menu.

The process of the program is displayed in the following model. A description of the methods can be found below.

![Takeaway program model](program_model.png)

It includes the following features:

  * display() - enables a user to view a menu
  * select() - enables a user to place specified menu items into a basket. The method takes a unlimited number of arguments in the form of a hash with the dish name and quantity specified. See an example of this in the screenshot below.
  * place_order() - enables a user to place an order.
      * This method takes one parameter, the expected order total. This is then verified (the expected order total referenced against the actual order total) and if this equals the actual order total, the order is placed.
      * If the order total does not equal the actual order total, an error is raised.
      * When the order is placed, the user will receive an SMS text message letting them know that their order has been placed and will be with them in one hour.

An example of the user journey is below:
