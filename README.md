## Notes

This challenge saw the first time I implemented an external web API. In order to protect my Twilio account information I added the 'dotenv' gem to my Gemfile and ran bundle install. I then created a .env file in the root of my project directory, and added it to the gitignore file. I added three environment variables to the env file:
```
  export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=***********
  export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_AUTH=*********
  export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_NUM=+********
```
I added the following to the top of my ruby file:
```
  require 'dotenv'
  Dotenv.load
```
To access the information within my ruby program, I called the environment variables using the following syntax:
```
  ENV['TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID']
  ENV['TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN']
  ENV['TWILIO_AUTH_NUM']
```
Whilst my program does perform the all of the user stories, there are several things that I would like to do moving forward with the project.

-   As it stands, my classes are all very dependent on each other, and my tests cannot work in isolation. I wanted to create a double "menu" class for my tests but ran out of time.
-   Equally, I wasnâ€™t particularly happy with how I test drove the Twilio implementation. In the end I stubbed out the method that calls the service to text, so that RSpec doesn't trigger the program to send a message every time it is run.
-   My program is not very user friendly. I would like to add some sort of command line interface to improve the user experience.
-   Equally, I would like to privatise some of the methods so that they can only be called by other methods within the class.

Whilst I did not manage to create my program with low coupling, this challenge reinforced my understanding of RSpec mocks and doubles.
