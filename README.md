Fun challenge! Great to work on thinking about how classes interact and how to incorporate gems. Cool feeling to get sent a text thanks to some code I wrote - makes it feel 'real'. If I were able to spend more time on it I'd particularly like to think about how to refactor the way my Dish class is used and serves information to other classes - I think it's a bit messy. I'd also like to spend some time looking into how I'd have written rspec tests for the Twilio code, and how to mock the stuff it's accessing from the gem. I had some thoughts on refactoring the class that it pulls in as a dependency injected class instead and going from there, but didn't get round to getting it implemented.
