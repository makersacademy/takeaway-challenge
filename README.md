# Development Process

1) After creating a domain model from the user stories, I have decided to start by creating 2 units: a `menu` class, and an `order` class. The user will browse the `menu` before selecting items to add to their `order` basket. Functionality to remove items will also cause items to be deleted from the `order` basket. The user can check their order and total by viewing basket and if they confirm their `order`, they will receive a text message to confirm the delivery time of their `order`.

2) After initial creation of `Order` and `Menu`, I realised that another file would be needed to interact with the user so that they can select items from the menu. Allowing the user experience to build on my domain model should help structure the incremental development.
