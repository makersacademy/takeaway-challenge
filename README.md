- Struggled maintaining 100% coverage after implementing twilio.API. Put all twilio code on one line which brought test coverage back up from around 90% but feels like a cheat - Rubocop didn't like it.
- I was trying to use a hash to assign food items to a cost but I wasn't able to access the cost (value) from the key by using `@menu[from_menu]` it kept throwing an error to do with `nil`. Used a constant `PRICE` in the end in order to finish the challenge.
- `#price_check` is a pretty useless method as price is returned when you look at the Order object anyway. Thought I should include it though as the user story wanted me to confirm.
