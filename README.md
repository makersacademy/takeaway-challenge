```

      :' // ':   \ \ ''..'--:'-.. ':
      '. '' .'    \:.....:--'.-'' .'

 ```

==================
To solve this challenge, I did decide to create five different classes:

- TakeAway class : whose responsibility is to show the menu to the user

- Waiter class : whose responsibility is to take the order

- Cashier class : whose responsibility is to print an invoice

- Confirmer class : whose responsility is to check that the user is happy with the order

- Texter class : whose responsibility is to send an sms confirmation

===================================================
There is a weakness in the testing, as I couldn't find yet a way to mock the responses of the user correctly.

Here is an example of how the program runs:

2.3.1 :002 > chez_pawpaw = TakeAway.new

2.3.1 :003 > chez_pawpaw.show_menu
                  Menu
Soup                                  £2
Oreo ice cream                      £1.5
Pierogi                               £5
