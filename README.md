## The Task
The aim of this challenge was to re-create a takeaway company.
```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

## The Approach

It was assumed that the application would be implemented in the takeaway's backend software system, and thus a user interface was not created but rather the code to support said user system.
The application was developed following TDD principles.
In this application, several classes were created:
* `Dish`
* `Menu`
* `Order`
* `Restaurant`
* `Messenger`

The app allows to create several instances of a dish object in order to create different dishes with their respective prices. These dishes and price hashes are then initialised and hence loaded into a menu. At this point the user can choose to make different menus composed of different dishes (to allow for week/weekend menus). A new restaurant instance can then initialise different orders (with different menus), and add dish items to said orders. To close the order, the total price needs to be confirmed. If the right price is given, the order is confirmed and closed, at which point a confirmation text message is sent.


## Installing the APP
Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/dylanrhodius/takeaway-challenge) and then move into that repository.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:dylanrhodius/takeaway-challenge.git
$ cd takeaway-challenge
```

Load dependencies with bundle
```
$ gem install bundle
$ bundle install
```

## Using the APP
Load the app in IRB
```
$ irb
```
