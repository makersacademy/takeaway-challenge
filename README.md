Takeaway Challenge
==================

The challenge consists of four user stories with the functionality of:
* A customer being able to see a list of dishes with prices;
* A customer being able to select a number of several dishes;
* Being able to check the total being given matches the sum of various dishes in the order;
* Receive a confirmation text message saying that the order has been place and will be delivered at a certain time.

**Will be updated later when I have made more progress with the challenge.**
