#### User Stories

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

#### Hints on functionality implementation:
  * Ensure to have a list of dishes with prices
  * Place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
  * The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. It’s free.
  * Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
  * Use the Gemfile to manage gems
  * Make sure that Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
  * However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
  * Note that you can only send texts in the same country as you have your account. I.e. if you have a UK account you can only send to UK numbers.

* Advanced! (have a go if you're feeling adventurous):
  * Implement the ability to place orders via text message.

Approach to solving the challenge
-----
#### Domain model

###### Processed user stories

> Customer -> can **see Menu**

> Menu = list of Dishes

> Dish has name and price

> Customer -> can select from Menu and **place Order** (receive total amount and confirmation text message back)

>  - Customer -> will receive text Message "Thank you! Your order for the total amount of £[x] was placed and will be delivered before 18:52"

> Order = list of *selected* Dishes, their quantities, total amount

> Customer -> can **compare Order**'s total amount to Menu prices
