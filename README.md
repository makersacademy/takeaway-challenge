Task
-----
* Write a Takeaway program with the following user stories:

```
User story 1

As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

I broke own user story 1 into the variable 'dish_list', stored in an array, under a 'Dishes' class.

User story 2 
I was unsure about how the customer would be able to select dishes from the 'dish_list'. This would require some testing in IRB.
