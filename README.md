I'm very sorry to say that I tried to do my work this weekend on my laptop at home, and that I had serious problems with ruby version conflicts, stopping me from getting the twilio gem to work at all.

Similarly, rspec wouldn't work, failing in a way that made no sense to me, so I tried to do what I could without it, and even that lead to problems that made me feel like I haven't learnt anything (eg I couldn't even initialize a class in irb).  All of this triggered a minor depressive episode and I decided to stop working before it got worse, try and get a good night's sleep and approach the next week's learning as positively as I can.  I'm very disappointed in myself and hope I can get past this, and apologise for my failure, and hope I've learnt at least not to bother trying to use my own laptop for work in future.

Takeaway Challenge
==================

As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices


just need a menu hash of names => prices
menu class?





As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes


needs an order class that creates a new hash by selecting from the menu hash







As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

write a method in order that creates an itemised bill from your order




As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered


get twilio to work. work out how to get the current time and modify it to be an hour in the future.










* Hints on functionality to implement:
  * ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
  * place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
  * The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
  * Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
  * Use a Gemfile to manage your gems
  * Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
  * However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent

* Advanced! (have a go if you're feeling adventurous):
  * Implement the ability to place orders via text message.

* A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.
* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am
