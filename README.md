## Introduction

Welcome to my repo for the Makers Academy weekend challenge(2). My task was to test drive the creation of a set of classes/modules to satisfy the user stories below. I needed to design a takeaway program that displays a list of dishes (with prices), and allows the user to place an order, displays a sum total of what they have spent, and sends a text message confirmation to the user with details of their purchases (using Twilio API).

## Useage

## Specification

In order to be successful at this challenge, my code **MUST**:

- [ ] Display list of dishes with prices.
- [ ] Allows the user to select a number of dishes.
- [ ] Show the total cost of the order - and this amount should correspond with the price of each dish.
- [ ] Send a text message to the user with an order confirmation.
