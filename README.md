#Takeaway-Challenge
-------------------

## Synopsis

A program written in Ruby using OOP to do the following:

Initially program provides a list of takeaway dishes and prices on screen.

Users then can place the order by submitting an array of pairs of selected dishes (no.), their quantities plus  the user total of the cost as a check and their mobile phone number.

The program checks the sum.  If it is not correct then the program gives an error.

If correct the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".

The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.

Advanced users can also place orders by text message.


## Code Example

In project directory:

`ruby app_demo.rb`



## Motivation

This project exists as an example of Ruby OOP.

The approach is:

Write a plan of approach identifying messages (verbs) and objects (nouns) in user stories.

Write domain model.

Use TDD to incrementally code the require functionality using Red, Green, Refactor.




## Installation

Clode repo.

Run bundle


## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

From the root directory run `rspec`
