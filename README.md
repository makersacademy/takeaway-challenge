Summary
-------
* Got very confused with writing tests this week.
Stalled progress as I was looking to ensure I was testing behaviour and not state.
I also just found it hard to write tests for particular behaviour in this exercise.
* Still a long way to go with understanding class interaction
* Was unable to get environmental variables working to secure personal details.
* Unable to use mocks and stubs to prevent texts when running rspec

How to progress further? More research on Google into the concepts introduced in Week 2
