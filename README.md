Instructions
-------
This week's challenge on the 2nd week of Makers Academy is to build a Takeaway app with the users stories below. The program allows to view the menu, add/delete items from the basket, view the basket summary with the total cost of the order and finally placing the order. By completing the order, the customer will receive a text message with an estimated delivery time.

I have used Twilio API to send text messages when the order is complete.

Task
-----

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
