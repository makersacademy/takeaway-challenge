step 1: takeaway menu.

As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

New Class Takeaway
First I set up a method to print the takeaway menu with a list of items and their prices. From my understanding, i thought it would be a good idea to delagate this into a new method Menu, which held the menus in a hash within an array and also printed the menu. As this was delageted to a new class, i set the reader to private as Takeaway was not interested in this, it just needed to get menu to do so.


step 2: Selecting item from the menu and the amount

I also wanted menu to take control of the printing of the dishes on the menu, I therefore gave it a method to print the dishes into a string of dishes and prices.


This was another example where i used delegation. I did not want the Takeaway class to manage this process so delageted this to an order class. This class would add dishes to an array and the amount(portions) for that order. I wanted the tests to make sure that the program would add dishes ordered from the menu to the order and the number or dishes for each menu item. I also thought it important that the user could not select dishes that were not on the menu, I built in a fail into the add method to fail if an item was not on the menu. This threw up errors as i already had items on the menu but it was erroring for each, i resloved this with a true/false method has_dish? and added a before block to allow these 2 items to pass.

Step 3:

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

The statement seamed simple, I had to create a total amount price for the order placed and check it matches the total for the items ordered.

I began first by creating a test for the order class to total the items ordered and return a value. I created a totals method which injected the totals of each item and their amount into an array then adding them together. this worked by adding a private method 'item_totals' and multiplying the dish ordered by the number ordered. When I ran rspec it threw up errors in the takeaway_spec and menu_spec. I had to then implement tests in each to calculate the dishes ordered and the amount of each dish ordered. I came out with a working addition method which will need to be amended to included a £ sign infront of amount.



As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

Instructions
-------

* Challenge time: rest of the day and weekend, until Monday 9am
* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Task
-----

* Fork this repo
* Run the command 'bundle' in the project directory to ensure you have all the gems
* Write a Takeaway program with the following user stories:

```
As a customer

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

* Hints on functionality to implement:
  * Ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
  * Place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
  * The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. It’s free.
  * Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
  * Use the Gemfile to manage your gems
  * Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
  * However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
  * Note that you can only send texts in the same country as you have your account. I.e. if you have a UK account you can only send to UK numbers.

* Advanced! (have a go if you're feeling adventurous):
  * Implement the ability to place orders via text message.

* A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.
* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am


In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance will make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this weekend.

Notes on Test Coverage
------------------

You can see your [test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) when you submit a pull request, and you can also get a summary locally by running:

```
$ coveralls report
```

This repo works with [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) to calculate test coverage statistics on each pull request.
