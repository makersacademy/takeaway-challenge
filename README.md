14/2/15 - Solved Problem

Managed to code a very basic solution that can take an order for a single item, read it back, then send confirmation.

However this solution contains many bugs, over complicated methods and exhaustive code; plenty of room to refactor.

Also need to implement further testing/stubbing, and possible additional order and menu classes.
