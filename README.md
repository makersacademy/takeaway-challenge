Takeaway Challenge
==================

In this challenge, I separated the information into two classes - Menu and Customer.

The customer was the dominant class, with the ability to request and order from the menu. The menu class was often referenced, for example, to add dishes to the basket.

Please load customer.rb in IRB to run through the feature test.

Unfortunately, I am not very happy with my result for this task. Although the feature test works, Twilio kept failing
so I wasn't able to send the message to my phone. I will look into this in more detail at a later date.

I also struggled with RSpec a lot more than I had done in the previous task. Although I am confident with stubs and mocking, I did not have the time to intricately look into stubbing user input (gets.chomp), therefore, despite numerous attempts, the tests kept failing. I have decided to spend a lot more time reviewing RSpec this week so the same issues do not crop up in the future. I will also be more disciplined in making sure I do the tests prior to jumping into the feature test, to avoid these issues.

I hope you enjoy the feature test and I'm sorry my RSpec is not up to scratch!
