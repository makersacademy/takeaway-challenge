## Approach to Solution

This blog post explores this further: (https://tomstuart92.github.io/TomsTakeaway/)

The interface class is only responsible for accepting input from users and delegating to other classes.
The menu class is responsible for displaying understanding which items are on the menu.
The order class is responsible for aggregating items for the user to purchase.
The adapter class is responsible for the interaction of the core code with the Twilio API. It is the only untested class.

I have focused on ensuring minimal dependencies between my classes.
This was done using dependency injection, and limiting the number of public methods.

## Usage Instructions
From toms_takeaway.rb:
- Your takeaway can be accessed on the variable - TomsTakeaway.
- Use .show_menu to view menu.
- Use .new_order to start a new order.
- Use .order(item, quantity) to add item to order.
- Use .review_order to view a summary of the order.
- Use .checkout to checkout order.

In IRB:

```
$ irb -r './toms_takeaway.rb'
Welcome to Tom's Takeaway!

Use .show_menu to view menu.
Use .new_order to start a new order.
