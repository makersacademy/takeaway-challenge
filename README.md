Takeaway Challenge
==================

Welcome to The Scottish Takeaway web app.

It allows you to select items from the menu, see an itemised list of your order and enter your contact details in anticipation of receiving a text that will inform you when you can expect to collect your order.

*Note* I was unsuccessful in connecting to the Twilio node capacity as I was receiving an error regarding my authorisation token than I was unable to resolve in time. I know I would require help with this as, despite reading the documentation, I remain clueless.
