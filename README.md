Intro
-----

This is a program all about how, your burgers get flipped, turned upside down. So I'd like to take a minute here just to say; that this program handles online orders for a take-away.

Functionality
-------------

1. Order
  * Collect dishes selected from the menu into a meal.
  * Calculate total cost of meal from individual dish prices.
  * Allows a user to view how many of each dish their is in their meal, and price.
  * Allows user to confirm their final order.
  * Sends a text to the user to confirm their order has been placed.
2. Menu
  * List all available dishes and prices.
  * Let's a customer add a dish to their meal.
3. Dish
  * Contains the name, description and price of an individual dish.
4. Confirmation text
  * Has a message thanking customer for their order.
  * Gives an estimated delivery time, which is 1 hour from the time of order.
