## Task
I have been asked to write a Takeaway program that will include a menu with a list of dishes with their respective prices. People will be able to use the program to place their orders, via selecting the dishes they want and their respective quantities. The program will work out the total cost of their order and I will use Twilio in order to send text messages to let people know when their order will be ready. During testing, I will try to use stubs and doubles in order to isolate my tests.
