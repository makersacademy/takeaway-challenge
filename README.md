### Task
Write a Takeaway program from the following user stories, using the [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/sms/api):
```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

## Running tests

`rspec`

**Overall test coverage > 96%**  
(I didn't manage to implement a test in messenger.rb without sending a text)
