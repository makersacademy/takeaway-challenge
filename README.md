## About

This Takeaway programme allows users to place an order by viewing a menu and then adding and removing items from their basket. The user will then be provided with a basket summary and total price. If the sum is not correct the programme raises an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from the time of their order.
The text sending functionality is implemented using Twilio API.
