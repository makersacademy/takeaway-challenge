TAKEAWAY CHALLENGE

I was considering placing the list of dishes in an array rather than a hash, as an array would be easier to manipulate. I went ahead with a hash in the end bearing extendability in mind and the possibility that my code might be improved upon in the future with perhaps the ability to change either the meals or the prices individually through a GUI. Using a dictionary structure would be simpler for the developer in that case.

There is some work left to do, mostly a few more tests and the organisation of the calculate method, and the tests for the Calculator class.

PROBLEMS

 - I feel I underestimated the complexity (or my understanding) of the interaction between classes.

 - I also underestimated the amount of time I needed to work on this challenge, making the mistake

 - I couldn't figure out how to test my Dishes module.


 OVERVIEW

 I totally used the Chicago-style of testing without realising, which of course means I'm less likely to use Doubles. This week I will need to implement the London-style and finally wrap my head around Doubles once and for all.
