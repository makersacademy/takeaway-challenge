# Setup
------
You will need the following gems to test this:  
gem 'capybara'  
gem 'rake'  
gem 'rspec'  
gem 'rubocop'  
gem 'simplecov', require: false, group: :test  
gem 'simplecov-console', require: false, group: :test  
gem 'twilio-ruby'  

# Process
------
Intended to delegate responsibility to other classes. Understand theory, but practice is more difficult!  
```
principles_learned = ["Single Responsibility", "Encapsulation", "Delegation", "Test-driven development"]
principles_violated << principles_learned * 10
time_to_code_review < 2
current_status = "screwed"
```
