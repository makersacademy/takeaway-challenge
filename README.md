## Welcome 
-------

This is my Take-away challenge. I actually have two versions the second is in this directory saved as takeaway-challenge-v2. Neither are complete. 


## This Takeaway Challenge

This version of takeaway challenge uses two classes, Menu and Order, to communicate an order to be placed. 

The Menu class contains a list of choices as well as a #select method that can be used to return a specific dish from the menu @list. It will save these choices in an array @choices. 

I intended for the @hoices to be passed into the Order class and it to go from there really.



## Takeaway challenge V2 

I originally started with this one however abandoned as i found writing test doubles and stubs for this functionality pretty hard. However its fully functional bar not sending texts. 


It comprises of 3 classes, Customer, Menu and Order (4 if included sms stuff). Customer initializes its own order class. This version works with nested hashes as i thought this would provide greater fexibility and performance then an array. 

Menu stores a menu as a nested hash array. Customers can interact with any menu object passed in - allowing multiple versions of Menu's - incase you can decide betweeen chinese or thai! 

users and menu have the ability to select a particular dish. Users can add this choice into their order class. 

Menu includes :Select allowing us to choose a dish
 
Order includes the functionality to :add, :sum and :close.

Customer includes : check_menu, :add, check_order_total, :new_order : place_order

all methods are designed to be single responsiblity. I made Order a part of customer as they couldnt exist without each other. 

is the logic ok??




Instructions
-------

* Challenge time: rest of the day and weekend, until Monday 9am
* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Task
-----

* Fork this repo
* Run the command 'bundle' in the project directory to ensure you have all the gems
* Write a Takeaway program with the following user stories:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

* Hints on functionality to implement:
  * Ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
  * Place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
  * The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
  * Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
  * Use the Gemfile to manage your gems
  * Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
  * However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
  * Note that you can only send texts in the same country as you have your account. I.e. if you have a UK account you can only send to UK numbers.

* Advanced! (have a go if you're feeling adventurous):
  * Implement the ability to place orders via text message.

* A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.
* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am


In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance will make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this weekend.
