Approach
-------
* This takeaway project was done in Ruby.

* The task was solved in a test driven manner using rspec. Due to there being multiple classes, doubles and stubs had to be used to ensure their isolation in testing.

* The problem was split into 3 classes responsible for 3 separate issues.

* The first was a Menu class that was responsible for storing the menu and listing it. I chose a menu from a local Indian to replicate, because it's delicious.

* The second was a Order class that was responsible for storing the oder and the associated price.

* The last was a Message class responsible for sending a message to the customer confirming the order and delivery time.

* APIs we're kept private by storing them in a separate file, that was listed on the gitignore.
