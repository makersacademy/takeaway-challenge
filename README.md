```

## Task

- Fork this repo
- Run the command 'bundle' in the project directory to ensure you have all the gems
- Write a Takeaway program with the following user stories:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

- Advanced! (have a go if you're feeling adventurous):
  - Implement the ability to place orders via text message.

## Objectives

To understand the single responsibilty principle and how gems can be used to add functionality to a program.

##Â Technology

- Ruby
- Twilio
- Rspec
