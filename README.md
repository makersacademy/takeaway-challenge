Instructions
------------

My personal solution of my second weekend challenge at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/).

* The repo @ Makers has been forked and cloned
```
$ git clone https://github.com/manuciao/takeaway-challenge.git
```
* The command 'bundle' in the project directory has been run to ensure I had all the gems
```
$ bundle install
```
Run makersinint to track my commits 
```
$ gem install makersinit 
$ makersinit
```
* The Takeaway program has been written referring to the following user stories:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

Notes on Test Coverage
------------------

You can see your [test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) when you submit a pull request, and you can also get a summary locally by running:

```
$ coveralls report
```

This repo works with [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) to calculate test coverage statistics on each pull request.
