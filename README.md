Outcome
-------
Testing this weekend went out the window (blaming a weekend in London for this one).

What I was able to do:

- Create Menu class to load a menu from a csv file.
- Create Customer class to allow a customer to select dishes and add it to an order.
- Create Order class to receive an incoming order and total it up.
- Create ConfirmationTextSender class which used the Twilio API to send text confirmation to the user.

What I wasn't able to do (yet - could do this with more time):

- Need to mock user input.
- Create guard clauses that throw errors when user inputs incorrect dish.
- Currently dishes are listed by number but I can implement functionality to type the name of the dish in and do a search for that item.
- Allow ConfirmationTextSender to send the full order to the customer.
- Allow the user to send orders via text.
- Couldn't get rspec to load. Possibly something to do with the twilio gem. Rspec runs when twilio is required, but will not work in irb. Rspec fails when twilio-ruby is required, however this does work in irb.
- Generally tidy it up a lot.
