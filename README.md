The challenge was to write a Takeaway program with the following user stories:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```
Started by planning how many classes I would need and what the each class would be responsible for. Initially needed a Menu class to store the menu and a Takeaway class as the main class a user would use. As well as Order and Text class to complete all functionality required by user stories.

If I had more time I would make it so you can order from your phone and improve this README greatly, firstly, to show how the the program works.
