TO EXECUTE PROGRAM
-----
Type in `ruby script.rb` into prompt when you are in the /lib folder

Once the order is complete an SMS will be sent to their phone (currently only sends to mine).

There are currently no guard conditions at the moment.
Please type in the number of the ranges provided.

NO SPEC FILES

This program was written so I could see what each Class was going to do.
I will go back, refactor, and build it up with TDD.
