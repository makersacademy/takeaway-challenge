**NOTE!** Being the superstar I am, I managed to forget to fork the original repo.
I built one from scratch and am now copying and pasting over. Thus it won't have my
commit history. The original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/punchcafe/takeaway-challenge).

# Takeaway-Challenge

This repo was made as coursework for the second weekend challenge. The challenge was
to build a simple command line application which emulates a takeaway service.

## Running the application
After downloading the directory, run `bundle install` from the command line in the root directory.
From the root directory, run `lib/run.rb` with your ruby interpreter.

A list of instructions can be printed to console with the `help` keyword.


**Note:** Before running, you will need to set environmental variables `$TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`,`$TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `$TWILIO_NUMBER` and `$MY_NUMBER`, to the respective values of your Twilio account. These can be generated by making a trial account on the [Twilio Website](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio).
