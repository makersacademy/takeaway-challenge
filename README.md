Takeaway Challenge
==================

How I Worked
----

I aimed to complete this challenge in a test driven manner, using automated feature and unit tests with rspec. I would convert each individual user story into a failing feature test and then work on each individual segment as a new failing unit test. I have aimed to commit every test cycle so you can view my process.

I have tried to encapsulate my code as much as possible throughout.

Installation Instructions

Running the Program
----

Brief
----

Write a takeaway program with the following user stories

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```
