Takeaway Challenge.

This repository stores my attempt to solve the Makers Takeaway Challenge.

The challenge is based on four user stories:

1) As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

2) As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

3) As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

4) As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered

---> I managed to finish the third user story. Detailed evidence of each step taken during the creation of the solution is in the files "Takeaway Challenge step-by-step 1" and "Takeaway Challenge step-by-step 2".

For the fourth user story I have created an account at Twilo and installed the Twilo gem.

This is still a draft.
