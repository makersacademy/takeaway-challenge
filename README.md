### What it does

This challenge aims to simulate a takeway interface of a restaurant where you'll be able to select dishes from a menu, place orders, check total with prices and receive a confirmation text notification. 

### How to use

run ruby takeaway.rb


### How I plan on making it work

Using the user stories, I'm going to plan out my objects and messages passed in between them and implement them in a domain model. 

Using the Domain Model I will begin writing out my class structure and implement TDD by writing feature tests, which in turn will identify the unit tests needed to write the code for this program.
