Instructions
-------

* Challenge time: rest of the day and weekend, until Monday 9am
* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc. but work on your own
* If you refer to the solution of another coach or student, please put a link to that in your README
* If you have a partial solution, **still check in a partial solution**
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Task
-----

* Fork this repo
* Run the command 'bundle' in the project directory to ensure you have all the gems
* Write a Takeaway program with the following user stories:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

* Hints on functionality to implement:
  * Ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
  * Place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
  * The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
  * Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
  * Use the Gemfile to manage your gems
  * Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
  * However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
  * Note that you can only send texts in the same country as you have your account. I.e. if you have a UK account you can only send to UK numbers.

* Advanced! (have a go if you're feeling adventurous):
  * Implement the ability to place orders via text message.

* A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.
* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am


In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance will make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this weekend.

Notes on Test Coverage
------------------

You can see your [test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) when you submit a pull request, and you can also get a summary locally by running:

```
$ coveralls report
```

This repo works with [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/) to calculate test coverage statistics on each pull request.

October 08, 2016

- Forked the repo on my personal Github account
- Cloned it on my makers macbook in "/Users/Dio22/Makers_Academy/Weekend_Challenges/Week2_takeaway_challenge"
- Installed ruby-2.3.1
- Installed and initialized the makersinit gem
- Installed and runned `bundle` to ensure all gems are present for this project
- The twilio gem was included in the Gemfile and installed
- User (me) signed up for an account


## FIRST USER STORY
- The user, a customer wants to check a list of dishes with prices.
- A takeaway class is required to offer the customer with dish options
- takeaway_spec file created to test for the takeaway class
- see_menu method that will list the menu to the user
- the menu is a new class that is initialized with an array of different dishes stored in hashes

## SECOND USER STORY
- A new Order class is created to allow selection of items from the menu list
- new spec file for order and Order class
- for each order, the menu will be required for selection of items
- initially, the order has 0 total to pay and no items in the selection(current_order)
- select_dishes method will accept the item number as an argument in order to include dish in the selection of items

## THIRD USER STORY
- in the order class, using the map method, calculated the total price by adding the price from each hash in the selection array
- implementing the checkout_price method in takeaway class to call the method from the order class

## FOURTH USER STORY
- when the order is placed, a text message will be sent to the user
