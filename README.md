This is a simple program for a takeaway app, looking at the following stories:

As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered

some extras:

Ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
The text should state that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
Use the Gemfile to manage your gems
Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
Note that you can only send texts in the same country as you have your account. I.e. if you have a UK account you can only send to UK numbers.
