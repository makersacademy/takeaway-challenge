<h2>Project Aim</h2>

To create a basic application in Ruby that fulfils the following user stories:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

<h2>Project Functionality</h2>
* A list of dishes with prices that can be viewed on demand by a customer.
* Customer can place order by providing a list of dishes and their desired quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
* The text sending functionality has been implemented using Twilio API and twilio-ruby gem to access the API.
* Thorough unit testing with RSpec and the following RSpec functionality: lets helpers, doubles, mocks, method stubs, spies

<h2>Tech Stack</h2>
* Ruby
* IRB & PRY
* RSpec
* Atom
* Twilio API & twilio-ruby gem
