As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

Usage
-------

* Dishes are created with two arguments, one for name (either a string or a symbol is acceptable) and a price.
* A Menu is created by feeding an optional number of dishes in as arguments to be stored on the object, more can be manually added later in the terminal
* An Order is created by supplying the following 
    * A Menu (to show it is flexible, real use case can set a default, but allow changes for seasonal menus)
    * A TwilioApi, separated to cater to SRP
    * A customer number, which must currently be supplied as a string with the correct dialing formats (I.E '+44123456789' for UK numbers)
    * This currentky uses manual dependency injection in cases to allow optional creation, but this can easily be set to a default for ease of use
* Once your objects are initialized you can use the add_dish method on the Order object to take menu items into the basket
* The Menu has functionality to return errors if non existent items are selected
* Once the customer is satisfied with the order they can use the check_total method to see the price, and the complete_order method to receive a confirmation text


Successes
-----

* Successful usage of complex doubles with stubbed attributes and methods
* Multiple uses of dependency injection to create a flow of functionality from dependent to controlling objects
* A successful use of the Twilio gem to send a text
* Debugged Twilio API using their documentation

------------------

To improve
-----
* Test coverage is incomplete as I was unsure how to test for the output of the text messages timer function without complex REGEX
* Current iteration satisfies User story but is not particularly user friendly and would make for a poor product
* Improper usage of environment variables meant that the Twilio IRB test had to be hard coded with real info, requires further study
* Testing for Twilio API is inadequate, but using stubbed methods to check for results is not an adequate test as it can pass with no text being sent
