In this mini-project I partially created a command line app for ordering a takeaway, using TDD.

This project was a weekend challenge for Makers Academy bootcamp (week 2 of 12).

Below were the user stories to utilize:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

I created two classes: Menu and Takeaway. My idea here was that Takeaway should encompass everything you would do at an actual takeaway restaurant - read a menu, order items by putting those items in a basket, and being able to check what was in your basket.

What I still need to work on in this project is:

1. Adding the ability to update the prices
2. Making sure that what the customer orders is actually on the menu
3. Totalling the price of the items ordered
4. Setting up the Twilio API to send out confirmation texts
5. Implementing doubles correctly - right now I understand the theory of them, but not the actual use of them
