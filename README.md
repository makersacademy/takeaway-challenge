Takeaway Challenge
==================
Second weekend challenge required us to create a takeaway with a menu object containing a list of dishes. Which allowed customers to place orders.
- Had to use knowledge of Object Oriented Programming to allow classes to interact
- Used doubless in testing to mock the interaction and isolate the unit tests 

## Tests ##

Tests are made using the rspec ruby gem. 

First install rspec by running this in your terminal: 'gem install rspec'  

Run 'rspec' in your terminal when inside the 'boris_bikes' directory to use them.
