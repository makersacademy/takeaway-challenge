A project that creates a Takeaway program that will take an order and send a confirmation text message. 

The aim of this challenge is to - 
- Practice TDD - use feature and unit tests from the begining (these can be seen in thee process.md file)
- Keep the code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc. (SRP)
- Using the Gemfile to manage gems
- Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
