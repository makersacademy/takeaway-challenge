Info
-----

A takeaway program that follows the below user stories:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

Coding approach
-----

TDD using RSpec

I tried to design the program using Single Responsibility Principle, but ended up with more than I would like inside the `Order` class in particular. If I had more time available I would have extracted that probably into a basket and checkout class, and maybe an Orders class for storing all orders (not currently a requirement in the user stories).

I stored the menu hash in a class of it's own as a constant.

When running `order.checkout` it confirms the amount in the CLI, resets the basket and sends a confirmation text message via Twilio.


Running the program
-----

The interface for the program is CLI - so jump into IRB or PRY and run it like so:

```
require './requires'
=> true

chinese = Takeaway.new
=> #<Takeaway:0x007fda62bc0180 @menu= #<Menu:0x007fda62bc0158
   @dishes={"Pilau Rice"=>2.2, "Egg Fried Rice"=>2.5}>,
 @order=#<Order:0x007fda62bc00b8 @basket=[],
   @menu=#<Menu:0x007fda62bc0158
     @dishes={"Pilau Rice"=>2.2, "Egg Fried Rice"=>2.5}>>>

chinese.basket
=> RuntimeError: Nothing in basket

chinese.menu
=> "Pilau Rice, £2.20\nEgg Fried Rice, £2.50\n"

chinese.order("Pilau Rice")
=> "1x Pilau Rice, £2.20 - added to your basket"

chinese.order("Pilau Rice")
=> "2x Pilau Rice, £4.40 - added to your basket"

chinese.basket
=> "2x Pilau Rice, £4.40\n"

chinese.total
=> "Total: £4.40"

chinese.checkout
=> "Order received, Total: £4.40"

chinese.basket
=> RuntimeError: Nothing in basket
```
Note the checkout sends a test SMS that only sends to my mobile phone.
