Comments
-------

I attempted the first three user stories. However my attempt is incomplete. although my spec is passing my feature test is not producing my intended result. it only prints the first order. 

how can I go about improving the code? for a week 2 student is this the level of coding I should be at? 
Task
-----


```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
