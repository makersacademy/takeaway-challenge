Task
-----

* Write a Takeaway program with the following user stories:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

Expected User Journey
-----

1) User presented with a displayed menu
2) User can input number corresponding to item on the menu (if number entered doesn't match any items on the menu, prompt is redisplayed)
3) Item selected is added to the order
4) Output displays current order status (number of items, total price)
5) User can add another item or finish their order
6) Finishing order displays final summary of the order
7) Once user confirms order, text message is sent

How To Use The App
-----
CD into program directory
```
ruby menu.rb
```

When running RSpec, you need to comment out the following code in menu.rb:

```
start = Menu.new
start.app
```

![Start The Order](https://github.com/s-palmer/takeaway-challenge/blob/main/images/start_order.png)
![Order Confirmation](https://github.com/s-palmer/takeaway-challenge/blob/main/images/order_confirmation.png)

Current Functionality
-----
* Users are able to select from a choice of 8 menu items by entering the number corresponding to the dish they want to add.
* Once they have selected all dishes, they can complete their order and will be presented an order summary with a total price.

Current Bugs
-----
* Entering non-numeric characters or characters outside of the menu range will raise issues, either:
- Crashing the app
- Causing erroneous items to be added.

Things to work on
-----
* Some Class extraction to move some methods from menu class to order class
* Twilio SMS sending
* Tests

## Hints on functionality to implement:
  * Ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
  * The text should state that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
  * The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
  * Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
  * Use the Gemfile to manage your gems
  * Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
  * However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
  * Note that you can only send texts in the same country as you have your account. I.e. if you have a UK account you can only send to UK numbers.

* Advanced! (have a go if you're feeling adventurous):
  * Implement the ability to place orders via text message.

* A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.

> :warning: **WARNING:** think twice before you push your **mobile number** or **Twilio API Key** to a public space like GitHub :eyes:
>
> :key: Now is a great time to think about security and how you can keep your private information secret. You might want to explore environment variables.

* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am


In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance will make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this at this moment.

Notes on Test Coverage
------------------

You can see your [test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/pills/test_coverage.md) when you run your tests.
