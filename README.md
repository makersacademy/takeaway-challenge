 ## questions
 1 -  I was not sure about selecting array or hash for menu_list. I used this demonstration: list={ [id: , dish_name:, dish_price:] ] }. The main reason using this, user selects menu_list_number from the menu. (for example list[1]), and then dish comes inside hash automaticly dish= {id:, dish_name:, dish_price:} which i found useful. Because, user only puts menu list_number instead of typing dish name and then i can easily play with dish using hash advantages(key, value pair). Some of my friends used only hash.
 I think mine is more complicated. How can i do easily ? or Was it correct which i have done ?

 2- About dependency injection: what are the differences between def initialize(s = nil) { @s = s || S.new} and def initialize(s= S.new) {@s = s} and def initialize(s:) { @s = s || S.new}

 3- I created a lot of doubles. Not sure some of them are required or not.

 4- Inside the basket class with the adding function, when it multiplies with value tag, it changes every values which is tagged by price. How can i correct this ? I want to change only the dish which is adding currently.
 for example :
 adding(dish ={id:1, name:pizza, price:1}
 second adding
 adding({id:1, name: kebap, price:2} )
  dish[price:] * 2( 2 is quantity of dish)
  dishes = {{id:1, name:pizza, price:2},{id:1, name: kebap, price:4}}
  I just wanted to change last dish price.

  5- may i get any feedbacks about my code quality, specially about doubles and mocks ( please ignore sms part, i just copied form somewhere)

  thanks you! This is my first time for getting reviews by coaches. I found that writing questions in readme file saves time. Please dm me, if you think i can improve my requesting structure more...

Stories

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

* Hints on functionality to implement:
  * Ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
  * Place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
  * The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
  * Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
  * Use the Gemfile to manage your gems
  * Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
  * However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
  * Note that you can only send texts in the same country as you have your account. I.e. if you have a UK account you can only send to UK numbers.

* Advanced! (have a go if you're feeling adventurous):
  * Implement the ability to place orders via text message.

* A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.

> :warning: **WARNING:** think twice before you push your **mobile number** or **Twilio API Key** to a public space like GitHub :eyes:
>
> :key: Now is a great time to think about security and how you can keep your private information secret. You might want to explore environment variables.
