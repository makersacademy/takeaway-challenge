#### This program allows the user to order from their chosen cuisine, and get confirmation of their order via text. This program was built using the [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/) as a Ruby gem.

#### The User stories considered:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

### How to run

*Clone this repo and install the following:*

```
gem install bundler
gem install twilio-ruby
bundle
# you may be asked to install ruby '2.4.0'
# remember you will need a Twilio account and you will need to input your info into TwilioAPI
```

*You can now start ordering! Run this program from the command line in IRB*

```ruby
require './lib/restaurant'
restaurant = Restaurant.new
# this program runs the default menu, but feel free to customise in Menu class!
# the menu included as default:
# @cuisine = { 'ramen' => 5, 'bun' => 3, 'noodles' => 4 }
restaurant.read_menu
#         Menu       
# ***********************
# Ramen                £5
# Bun                  £3
# Noodles              £4
restaurant.order('noodles', 2)
# => "2x noodles(s) added to basket"
restaurant.add('ramen')
# => "1x ramen(s) added to basket"
restaurant.basket
# 2x noodles(s) = £8
# 1x ramen(s) = £5
restaurant.add('bun', 3)
# => "3x bun(s) added to basket"
restaurant.add('pizza')
# => RuntimeError: Unfortunately pizza isn't available
restaurant.basket
# 2x noodles(s) = £8
# 1x ramen(s) = £5
# 3x bun(s) = £9
restaurant.total(22)
# => "Total: £22 Would like to checkout or add more to your order?"
restaurant.checkout(22)
# => "Order successful! You have paid £22. Please await text confirmation"
# The User will be sent a text when #checkout is called.
# The text will confirm the order and tell them the time of arrival
```

#### Problems encountered:

1. Iterating through orders to return the total cost

- When iterating through the 'basket' hash of in the Order class, I needed to delete or ignore the orders after being added to the total to avoid adding the same orders on every iteration.
To get around this I cloned the basket hash, iterated through the clone adding to the total. I could then delete the clone knowing that order had been added and the basket would stay intact.
This goes against DRY principles and I will consider refactoring this particular behaviour.

2. Testing using mocks and doubles across multiple classes

3. Testing the TwilioAPI directly
