Task
-----
Week 2 challenge at Makers Academy: Create a Takeaway program with text sending functionality implemented using Twilio API.
Here are the user stories for this challenge:
```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```
Approach
-----
I created three classes: 
- Takeaway: used to show menu and place order
- Menu: used to print the menu
- Order: used to select dishes and calculate total
- Message: used to send message to customer with estimated delivery time implemented with Twilio API
