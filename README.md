Takeaway Challenge
==================
[![Build Status]()
[![Coverage Status]()

Introduction
-------
 I've been learning to program with ruby for 6 weeks now, and this was the second weekend challenge given to us by Makers Academy.

 The challenge was to create a takeaway program that uses the Twilio API to send text message confirmations on orders placed.

Task
-----

* Answer the question `What is a ruby gem? Give a code example showing how to use a ruby gem in a piece of code. What are some dangers to using a gem?`

* Write a Takeaway program with the following user stories:

User Stories
----------
```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
<!-- I would like to see a list of dishes with prices -->

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
<!-- I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes -->

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
<!-- I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order -->

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
<!-- I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered -->
```
Model
-------
  * Hints on functionality to implement:
  * ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
  * place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
  * The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
  * Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
  * Use a Gemfile to manage your gems
  * Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
  * However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent

* Advanced! (have a go if you're feeling adventurous):
  * Implement the ability to place orders via text message.

* A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.
* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am


**Note: We are looking for good OO design and programming! Remember the Single Responsibility and Dependency Injection/Inversion principles!**
