# Areas completed

- There is a menu which prints out the items and their prices.

- Users are asked which item they want, they input it and that input is stored.

- The user can ask to print their order and ask for a total.

# Areas to work on

- I could not get the formatting to match the suggested format in the hints section.

- The user has to input each item individually when ordering.

- The twilio SMS section is incomplete.

# Reflection

- I struggled with fitting the item, quantity and price on the print out.

- I struggled to understand how to get twilio working.

- I spent ages trying to figure out how to get the right rspec test for test which rely on user input and test which anticipate a string output.
