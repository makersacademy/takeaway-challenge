# Takeaway Challenge #
### Makers Academy - Weekend 2 Project ###

##### In this challenge I will be attempting to create a solution that:
######    * Allows a takeaway menu to be read
######    * Allows a user to select multiple dishes
######    * Allows the user to check the total against the menu
######    * Sends the user a text confirmation on order completion



##### User Story as below:
```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```
