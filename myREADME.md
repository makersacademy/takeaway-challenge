I decided that I wanted the menu to load automatically from a csv file, as I thought that would be closer to how a user might do it i.e. load their menu 

The test menu used in development is:

Dish | Price
------ | ------
Soup | £5.00
Burger | £10.00
Pasta | £8.00
Fish | £12.00
Salad | £6.00
