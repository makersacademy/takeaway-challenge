"I spent a couple of hours planning this project before writing any code. Before the planning I had an issue where after installing a new version of Ruby I couldn't load any of my gems. RVM seemed to be looking in the system Library of Ruby 2.0.0. I reinstalled Bundler and all gems worked after that. It seems every day starts off with a bug fix and a learning experience on command line and mac file structure. I drew up a domain model displaying responsibilities and created the user story diagrams. It seems too simple, expecting the challenge to get much harder halfway through when I encounter Twilio."

I'm spending a lot of time looking for the rspec matcher that does what I need for the situation. Frustrating as it's not an issue with understanding rspec syntax or how to use it, it's simply that the documentation is poor and the internet is full of the old syntax. Trying to do simple test: whether a method returns an array.
