"I spent a couple of hours planning this project before writing any code. Before the planning I had an issue where after installing a new version of Ruby I couldn't load any of my gems. RVM seemed to be looking in the system Library of Ruby 2.0.0. I reinstalled Bundler and all gems worked after that. It seems every day starts off with a bug fix and a learning experience on command line and mac file structure. I drew up a domain model displaying responsibilities and created the user story diagrams. It seems too simple, expecting the challenge to get much harder halfway through when I encounter Twilio."
