 * First commit - This is later than intended and follows the additional step
  * Set up file with takeaway, takeaway_spec, menu, menu_spec.
  * have written and passed 2 tests in takeaway_spec
  * have written and passed 1 test in menu_spec
  * all functionality was checked in IRB in the first instance

  - User story 1 completed - when takeaway.menu is called the menu list is given.

  * decided that user story demanded different functionality, went back and changed
  * takeaway now initializes with a menu pulled from Menu class

  - Working on user story 2

  * commited after passing green for "order with any args".
