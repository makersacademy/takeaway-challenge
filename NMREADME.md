 ```

 * First commit - This is later than intended and follows the additional step
  * Set up file with takeaway, takeaway_spec, menu, menu_spec.
  * have written and passed 2 tests in takeaway_spec
  * have written and passed 1 test in menu_spec
  * all functionality was checked in IRB in the first instance

  - User story 1 completed - when takeaway.menu is called the menu list is given.

  * decided that user story demanded different functionality, went back and changed
  * takeaway now initializes with a menu pulled from Menu class

  - Working on user story 2

  * commited after passing green for "order with any args".
  * commited after initializing @cust_order as empty array"

  - Working on user story 3

  * commited after storing and returning customer order
  -
  * Order class is storing customer order
  -
  * Order class properly integrated

  -
  * Outputs summary of users choices
  * Outputs summary of cost

  -
  * Some refactoring and adjusting to get sum of cost.

  -
  * Got the list of food and cost returning

  -
  * installed Twilio and started following instructions, but didn't have the time to see
  * through as it was clearly a big part of the undertaking.
