ABOUT:		

This is a project/challenge set by the coding bootcamp Makers Academy and then completed by the AUTHOR as a learning assignment.

Consequently, all scripts not included in the 'lib' or 'spec' directory are the work of the staff at Makers Academy.
This README therefore only relates to these two directories.

The challenge is to build a simple takeaway ordering program with a messaging system to update the customer on their order's progress.

MY APPROACH:

I approached my design with the intention of making it very easy to adapt. I separated out classes based, in part, on the areas that would be most likely to be enhanced in the future:

The inclusion of different menus. Ie, breakfast vs dinner menus or different cuisines with example class of Italian Menu.

The separation of processing from the user's takeaway interface.

The separation of text-order processing from ordering with select.

The development of Customer Relationship Management functions, such as including different ways to message customers and store information about the customer.

THINGS I NEED TO DO


1. Write an ability to review and amend order before confirming it.



USER STORIES:

As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
